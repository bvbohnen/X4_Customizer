Transforms to weapons.

Note: 
Weapon "class" values:
    ['weapon','missilelauncher','turret','missileturret','bomblauncher']
Bullet "class" values:
    ['bullet','missile','bomb','mine','countermeasure']

Notes on reload times:
    There are two basic weapon styles: single shot and burst.
    For single shot weapons:
        fire_rate = 1 / reload_time
    For burst weapons:
        Behavior is tracked in the ammo fields, where the weapon has a
        concept of loading ammo at ammo_reload intervals up to a ammo_max,
        then bursting it out at reload_rate.
        Ammo has to hit max before it can burst, and does a full burst,
        so the overall result is:
        burst_rate = 1 / (ammo_reload_time + 1/reload_rate * (ammo_max-1))

        If ammo_max == 1, then there is no reload_rate contribution
        since there is no time between burst shots, so the result
        is just:
        burst_rate = 1 / ammo_reload_time

        However, the in-game encylopedia seems to mess this up, using
        instead:
        burst_rate = 1 / (ammo_reload_time + 1/(reload_rate * (ammo_max-1)))
        This doesn't make any sense as-is, so consider it a bug.
        -Ingame testing verifies this is a bug.

doc_matching_rules = '''
    Weapon transforms will commonly use a group of matching rules
    to determine which weapons get modified, and by how much.

    Args are one or more dictionaries with these fields, where matching
    rules are applied in order, with a weapon being grouped by the first
    rule it matches. If a bullet or missile is used by multiple weapons
    in different match groups, their adjustments will be averaged.

    A dictionary has the following shared fields:

    * match_any, match_all, match_none
      - Lists of matching rules. Weapon is selected if matching nothing
        from match_none, and anything from match_any or everything from
        match_all.
    * skip
      - Optional, bool, if True then this group is not edited.
      - Can be used as a way to blacklist weapons.
      
    Matching rules are strings with the following format:
    * The "key" specifies the xml field to look up, which will
      be checked for a match with "value".
    * Supported keys for weapons:
      - 'name'  : Internal name of the weapon component; supports wildcards.
      - 'class' : The component class.
        - One of: weapon, missilelauncher, turret, missileturret, bomblauncher
        - These are often redundant with tag options.
      - 'tags'  : One or more tags for this weapon, space separated.
        - See Print_Weapon_Stats output for tag listings.
      - '*'     : Matches all wares; takes no value term.

    As a special case, a single multiplier may be given, to be applied
    to all weapons (lasers,  missiles, etc.)
